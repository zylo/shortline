          <p>
            It is a period of great uncertainty at Zylo. A secret pivot to a Star Wars analytics
            platform has been thrown into doubt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zylo engineers have managed to build a mostly-working prototype, but have run into
            serious obstacles and can go no further. However, all is not lost. Rumors of a front-end
            Jedi have reached the Zylo base.
          </p>
          <p>
            Help us, potential Zylo engineer. You&apos;re our only hope. Proceed to
            /secret_prototype to save our charts and the future of our business.
